                <p>
                    I have created a website(www.tree-tasmania.com) for the business by using WordPress plaform
                    associated with PHP, HTML and CSS, as well as undertaking the administrator role for the website. I
                    have achieved high client satisfaction, and successfully managed to complete all tasks on time. The
                    primary key to this success is communication. I have communicated with the client regularly, and
                    made sure the client and I have the same understanding about how to achieve success.
